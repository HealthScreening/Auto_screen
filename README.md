## How it works 
Check out the how-it-works page to see an in-depth explanation

tl;dr : Hits the login page from the portal to get cookies, logins with cookies to get OAuth keys to the kingdom, redeems those keys at an endpoint to get login cookies, uses login cookies to submit the form as the user 

## Todo
* Add a function to screenshot the success message so users can SMS the image to themselves 
* Clean up the code with functions and more comments
